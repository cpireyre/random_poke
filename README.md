# random_poke

If you don't know what this is, you probably don't want to install it.

Needs zsh.

```git clone https://github.com/cpireyre/random_poke.git && cd random_poke && ./install.sh```

Pass "fr" as argument to `poke.sh` for French language shiny notifications.
(E.g. `~/random_poke/poke.sh fr`)
